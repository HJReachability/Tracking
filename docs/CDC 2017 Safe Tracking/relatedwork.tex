\subsection{Fast Trajectory Planning}
A large focus of the controls community is in developing motion planners for dynamic and kinematic systems. 
Path planning with polynomial smoothing
Motion Primitives (to make faster: polynomial trajectory optimization)
MPC (to make faster: decompose state space into convex regions)
generate a bunch of trajectories
\subsection{Safe Trajectory Planning}
reachability
tunnel stuff
robust mpc
pavone's paper
Control barrier functions
