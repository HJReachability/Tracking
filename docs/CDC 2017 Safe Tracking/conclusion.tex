\section{Conclusions and Future work}
In this paper we introduced our new tool FaSTrack: Fast and Safe Tracking. This tool can be used to add robustness to various path and trajectory planners without sacrificing fast online computation. So far this tool can be applied to unknown environments with a limited sensing range and static obstacles. We are excited to explore several future directions for FaSTrack in the near future, including exploring robustness for moving obstacles, adaptable error bounds based on external disturbances, and demonstration on a variety of planners.
