\section{Conclusions and Future work}
In this paper we introduced our new tool FASTrack: Fast and Safe Tracking. This tool can be used to add robustness to various path and trajectory planners without sacrificing fast online computation. So far this tool can be applied to unknown environments with a limited sensing range and static obstacles. Next steps will involve exploring robustness for moving obstacles, adaptable error bounds based on external disturbances, and demonstration on a variety of planners. \MCnote{I would add a bit of future work}
