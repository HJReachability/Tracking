\section{Offline Computations \label{sec:precomp}}

To precompute the tracking bound we set up a capture-avoid game between the real and virtual vehicles, which we then analyze using HJ reachability. In this game, the real system will try to "capture" the virtual system, while the virtual system is doing everything it can to avoid capture. By using reachability to analyze this game we will get a guaranteed bound on how far apart the two vehicles will ever be even when the virtual system is acting as inconveniently as possible.

\subsection{Relative Dynamics}
The states and dynamics of the real system, as defined in section \ref{sec:formulation}, are $\dot\tstate = \tdyn(\tstate, \tctrl, \dstb)$. The virtual system will have states $\vstate$, which we assume to be a subset of $\tstate$. The virtual system has dynamics $\dot\vstate = \vdyn(\vstate, \vctrl)$, with control $\vctrl$.
\SHnote{restrictions on $vctrl$?}

\textcolor{red}{introduce virtual dynamics, explain that it must be a subset of real system dynamics}
We now have the dynamics for the individual systems, but to set up the capture-avoid game we must first define the relative states and dynamics. We place the virtual vehicle at the origin by subtracting its states $(\vstate)$ from the real system's states $(\tstate)$. In this frame of reference $(\rstate)$ we are given the states of the real system relative to the virtual system. 

Dynamics of system
\begin{equation}
\dot\vstate = \vdyn(\vstate, \vctrl, \dstb)
\end{equation}

Dynamics of trajectory

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\rstate = \tstate - \tvmat\vstate\\
\dot\rstate = \rdyn(\rstate, \tctrl, \vctrl, \dstb)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Matrix $\tvmat$ matches the common states of $\tstate$ and $\vstate$. The states $\rstate$ now represent the real state relative to the virtual state.

\subsection{Formalizing the Capture-Avoid Game}
Now that we have the relative dynamics between the two systems we must define a metric for the tracking error bound between these systems. We do this by defining an implicit surface function as a cost function $\errfunc(\rstate)$ in the new frame of reference \SHnote{requirements on $l(\rstate)$} Because the metric we care about is distance to the origin, this cost function can be as simple as negative distance in position space to the origin. An example can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:quad4D_example}-a, where the rings represent varying level sets of the cost function. The true vehicle will try to maximize this reward to reduce the relative distance, while the virtual vehicle will do the opposite.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/quad4D_example}
	\caption{\textcolor{red}{a) cost function, b) value function, c) level sets of both mapping initial state to tracking error bound}}
	\label{fig:quad4D_example}
\end{figure} 
 
 We want to find the farthest distance (and thus highest cost) that this game will ever reach when both players are acting optimally. Therefore we want to find a mapping between the initial state of the system and the maximum cost achieved over the time horizon. This mapping is through our value function, defined as: \MCnote{Time horizon, time variable notation, control/disturbance functions, trajectory notation}
 \begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
 	V(\rstate)= \sup_{\vctrl(\cdot)} \inf_{\tctrl(\cdot), \dstb(\cdot)} \big\{\sup_{\tvar\in [0, \thor]} \errfunc(\rtraj(\tvar; \rstate, 0, \vctrl(\cdot), \tctrl(\cdot)))\big\}
 	\end{aligned}
 \end{equation} 
 
 This is a modified version of the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation as described by \textcolor{red}{cite jaime, time varying reachability}. By implementing reachability analysis we solve for this value function over the time horizon. If the control authority of the real system is powerful enough to always eventually reach the virtual system, this value function will converge to an invariant solution for all time.  An example of this value function is in Figure \ref{fig:quad4D_example}-b. In the next section we will prove that the sub-level sets of this value function will map initial relative states to the guaranteed furthest possible tracking error over all time, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:quad4D_example}-c.
 
\subsection{Main Result}

\SHnote{max/min to sup/inf, see if it's easy to change to [0,T] instead of [-T,0]}

 \begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
& \valfunc(\rstate, \thor) = \max_{\vctrl(\cdot)} \min_{\tctrl(\cdot), \dstb(\cdot)} \big\{\\
&\quad \min_{\tvar \in [-\thor, 0]} \errfunc(\rtraj(\tvar; \rstate, -\thor, \vctrl(\cdot), \tctrl(\cdot), \dstb(\cdot)))\big\} 
 \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
 
 \begin{thm}
   \label{thm:main}
   Let $\thor_c \ge 0$, and suppose
   
   \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:conv_valfunc}
   \valfunc_\infty(\rstate) := \valfunc(\rstate, \thor) = \valfunc(\rstate, \thor_c) ~ \forall \thor \ge \thor_c.
   \end{equation}
   
   Then $\forall \tvar_1, \tvar_2$ with $\tvar_1 \ge \tvar_2$,
   
   \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:invariant}
   \valfunc_\infty\Big(\rtraj(\tvar_2; \rstate, \tvar_1, \vctrl^*(\cdot), \tctrl^*(\cdot), \dstb^*(\cdot))\Big) \ge \valfunc_\infty(\rstate)
   \end{equation}
   
   \noindent where
   \begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
   & \vctrl^*(\cdot) = \arg \max_{\vctrl(\cdot)} \min_{\tctrl(\cdot), \dstb(\cdot)}\big\{ \\
   & \qquad \min_{\tvar \in [-\thor_1, 0]} \errfunc(\rtraj(0; \rstate, \tvar, \vctrl(\cdot), \tctrl(\cdot), \dstb(\cdot))) \big\}\\
   & \tctrl^*(\cdot) = \arg \min_{\tctrl(\cdot)} \min_{\dstb(\cdot)} \big\{ \\
   & \qquad \min_{t \in [-\thor_1, 0]} \errfunc(\rtraj(0; \rstate, \tvar, \vctrl(\cdot), \tctrl(\cdot), \dstb(\cdot))) \big\} \\
   & \dstb^*(\cdot) = \arg \min_{\dstb(\cdot)} \big\{\min_{\tvar \in [-\thor_1, 0]} \errfunc(\rtraj(0; \rstate, \tvar, \vctrl(\cdot), \tctrl(\cdot),  \dstb(\cdot))) \big\}
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation}
   
 \end{thm}
 
\textit{Proof:} For convenience, let

\begin{equation}
\rtraj^*(0;, \rstate, \tvar) := \rtraj(0; \rstate, \tvar, \vctrl^*(\cdot), \tctrl^*(\cdot), \dstb^*(\cdot)))
\end{equation}

First, we break up the expression ``$\min_{\tvar \in [-\thor, 0]}$'' into two parts with time intervals $[-\thor_c, 0], [-\thor, -\thor_c]$. For all $\thor \ge \thor_c$,
   
   \begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
   \valfunc(\rstate, \thor) &= \min_{\tvar \in [-\thor, 0]} \errfunc(\rtraj^*(\tvar; \rstate, -\thor)) \\
   &= \min \Big[ \min_{\tvar \in [-\thor_c, 0]} \errfunc(\rtraj^*(\tvar; \rstate, -\thor)), \\
   &\qquad\qquad\min_{\tvar \in [-\thor, -\thor_c]} \errfunc(\rtraj^*(\tvar; \rstate, -\thor)) \Big]
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation}
   
   Next, using \eqref{eq:conv_valfunc}, we have
   \begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
   \valfunc_\infty(\rstate) &= \min \Big[ \valfunc_\infty(\rtraj^*(-\thor_c; \rstate, -\thor)), \\
   &\qquad\qquad\min_{\tvar \in [-\thor, -\thor_c]} \errfunc(\rtraj^*(\tvar; \rstate, -\thor)) \Big]
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation}
   
   \noindent which trivially implies
   \begin{equation}
   \valfunc_\infty(\rstate) \le \valfunc_\infty(\rtraj^*(-\thor_c; \rstate, -\thor))
   \end{equation}
   
   Since the system dynamics are time-invariant, we can pick $\tvar_2 = -\thor_c$ without loss of generality, and $\tvar_1 = -\thor$ to obtain the desired result. \hfill $\blacksquare$
 
\begin{rem}
  The interpretation of Theorem \ref{thm:main}, particularly \eqref{eq:invariant}, is that every level set of $\valfunc_\infty(\rstate)$ is invariant under the following conditions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The real system applies the optimal control which tries to track the virtual system;
    \item The virtual system applies the optimal virtual control that tries to escape from the real system;
    \item The real system experiences the worst-case disturbance.
  \end{itemize}
  
  In particular, the value of $\underline\valfunc := \valfunc_\infty(\rstate)$ can be interpreted as the smallest possible tracking error \MCnote{(we need to explicitly define tracking error)} given the above assumptions. The tracking error bound in Fig. \ref{fig:fw_online}, \ref{fig:hybrid_ctrl}, \ref{fig:fw_offline} is given by\footnote{In practice, since $\valfunc_\infty$ is obtained numerically, we set $\TEB = \{\rstate: \valfunc_\infty(\rstate) \le \underline\valfunc + \epsilon\}$ for some suitably small $\epsilon>0$} the set $\TEB = \{\rstate: \valfunc_\infty(\rstate) \le \underline\valfunc\}$.
  
  \MCnote{what if disturbances are not optimal?}
\end{rem}
 
 
 \begin{rem} 
   Theorem \ref{thm:main} is very similar to well-known results in differential game theory with a slightly different cost function \cite{}, and has been utilized in the context of using the subzero level set of $\valfunc_\infty$ as a backward reachable set for tasks such as collision avoidance or reach-avoid games \cite{}. In our work we do not assign special meaning to any particular level set, and instead consider all level sets at the same time. This effectively allows us to perform solve many simultaneous reachability problems in a single computation, thereby removing the need to check whether resulting invariant sets are empty, as was previously done in \MCnote{SPP paper \cite{}}.
 \end{rem}
