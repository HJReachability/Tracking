\begin{abstract}

Fast and safe navigation of dynamic systems through cluttered environments is an area of research vital to exploring many applications of autonomous systems. However, trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles is a computationally intensive task, and balancing speed of planning with safety and dynamic feasibility is challenging. Simplified models of dynamics are easier to plan, but generally do not capture nonlinear behavior. Guaranteed safe trajectories can be computed for the more realistic and complicated dynamics of many autonomous systems, but performing online trajectory optimization in real-time with complicated dynamics is a computational intensive task. We propose our new framework FASTrack: Fast and Safe Tracking, which allows planners to use simplified dynamics to attain real-time planning while simultaneously a) maintaining safety guarantees and b) providing the optimal safety control for the autonomous system to track the planner. FASTrack is modular and can be used to add robustness to most path or trajectory planners.
% This is done by an offline precomputation and an online planning computation. The offline computation consists of formulating a capture-avoid game between a simplified planning model and and more sophisticated tracking model. We then use Hamilton Jacobi reachability analysis to find the maximum possible tracking error bound between these two systems, as well as a safety control function mapping the current relative state between the systems to the optimal safety control for the tracking system. Online, path or trajectory planning can be performed in real-time using the planning model, where sensed obstacles are augmented by the tracking error bound. The tracking error bound captures all possible deviations that may occur due to nonlinearities or external disturbances. As the planning occurs, the autonomous system determines the relative state between itself and the next desired position, and uses the precomputed safety control function to find the optimal tracking control. 
 We demonstrate this framework using a 10D nonlinear quadrotor model tracking a 3D linear RRT path planner. \color{red} results, etc.
