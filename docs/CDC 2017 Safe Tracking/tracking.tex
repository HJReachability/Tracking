\begin{abstract}

Quadrotors have become very popular in research and industry for tasks that require exploration of unknown environments. However, path planning for autonomous vehicles is a computationally intensive task, and balancing speed of planning with safety and dynamic feasibility is challenging. Simplified models of quadrotor dynamics are easy to plan, but do not capture nonlinear behavior. Guaranteed safe paths can be computed for more realistic and complicated dynamics of quadrotors, but these paths require heavy computational load. We propose a method that combines these two approaches. We formulate a capture-avoid game between a simplified model used for path planning and the true vehicle dynamics. We then use reachability analysis to precompute a mapping from the current relative state between the two systems to the worst possible tracking error bound over time, providing a "safety bubble" around the simplified system. This mapping also uses the relative state to determine the optimal control for the real vehicle to reduce the tracking error. Once the precomputation is complete, we perform path planning in real-time using the simplified model augmented by this safety bubble that captures all possible deviations due to nonlinearities or external disturbances. We implement this using a 10D quadrotor model tracking a 3D linear RRT path planner. \color{red} results, etc.
