\section{Introduction}
 As autonomous systems become more commonplace, it is essential to perform motion planning safely for navigating through unknown environments. However, for many dynamical systems, accurate and robust path planning can be computationally expensive. In order to achieve real-time planning, many algorithms use highly simplified models, resulting in a tracking error between the planned path and the system trajectory. External disturbances such as wind can also be difficult to account for. Crucially, such tracking errors can lead to dangerous situations in which the planned path is safe, but the actual system trajectory enters unsafe regions.
 
 %Real-time planning that is both safe and accurate presents a very difficult challenge: accuracy and robustness in many dyanimcal systme sis difficult to compute, often precluding real-time computer hands.fast planning is generally at odds with the need for maintaining safety and robustness.  


We propose the modular tool FaSTrack: Fast and Safe Tracking, which models the navigation task as a sophisticated \textit{tracking system} that pursues a simplified \textit{planning system}. The tracking system accounts for complex system dynamics as well as bounded external disturbances, while the simple planning system enables the use of real-time planning algorithms. Offline, a precomputed pursuit-evasion game between the two systems is analyzed using Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis to produce a ``safety bubble'' around the planning system. This safety bubble can be derived independent of the path planned in real-time. Online, the autonomous system senses local obstacles, which are then augmented by $\TEB$ to ensure that no potentially unsafe paths are computed. Based on the relative state between the two systems, an optimal \textit{least-restrictive} safety control is determined by table look-up. %Next, a path or trajectory planner uses the simplified planning model to determine the next desired state. The tracking system then finds the relative state between itself and the next desired state. If this relative state is nearing the boundary of $\TEB$, then it is plugged into the safety control function to find the instantaneous optimal safety control of the tracking system; otherwise, any controller may be used. In this sense, FaSTrack provides a \emph{least-restrictive} control law. This process is repeated until the navigation goal is reached. 

%This results in a \textit{tracking error function} that maps the initial relative state between the two systems to the \textit{tracking error bound}: the maximum possible relative distance that could occur over time. This tracking error bound ($\TEB$) can be thought of as a ``safety bubble" around the planning system that the tracking system is guaranteed to stay within. Because the tracking error is bounded in the relative state space, we can precompute and store a \textit{safety control function} that maps the real-time relative state to the optimal safety control for the tracking system to ``catch" the planning system. Note that the offline computations are \textit{independent} of the path planned in real-time.

FaSTrack is modular and can be used with any existing path or trajectory planners, enabling motion planning that is fast, guaranteed safe, and dynamically feasible. We demonstrate this tool in simulation for a 10D quadrotor affected by wind tracking a 3D kinematic model. Online, the simulated system travels through a static, windy environment with obstacles that are only known once they are within the limited sensing range of the vehicle. Combining the tracking error bound with a kinematic rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) fast path planner \cite{Kuffner2000, Kavraki1996}, the system is able to safely travel through the environment in real-time.
