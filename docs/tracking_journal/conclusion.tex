\section{Conclusions and Future work}
In this paper we introduced FaSTrack: Fast and Safe Tracking, which is a framework for providing trajectory-independent tracking error bounds (TEB) for a tracking system, which represents an autonomous system, and a planning system, which represents a simplified model of the autonomous system.
The TEB is obtained by analyzing a pursuit-evasion game between the tracking and planning systems, and obtaining the associated value function by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) variational inequality (VI).

By computing trajectory-independent TEB, our framework decouples robustness guarantees from planning, and achieves the best of both worlds -- formal robustness guarantees which is usually computationally expensive to obtain, and real-time planning which usually sacrifices robustness.
Combined with any planning method in a modular fashion, our framework enables guaranteed safe planning and re-planning in unknown environments, among other potential applications.
We demonstrated the framework's utility in three representative numerical simulations involving a 5D car model tracking a 3D car model planning using the fast sweeping method, a 10D quadrotor model tracking a 3D single integrator model planning using rapid-exploring random trees, and an 8D quadrotor model tracking a 4D double integrator planning using model predictive control.

Immediate future work includes reducing conservatism of the TEB by relaxing the worst-case assumption on the goals of the planning control, investigating ways such as decomposition to reduce computational complexity, incorporating methods other than solving the HJ VI for computing the value function, and validating our theory in hardware experiments.
