\begin{abstract}
Real-time and guaranteed safe trajectory planning is vital to many applications of autonomous systems, particularly for systems navigating in unknown environments.
However, algorithms for real-time trajectory planning typically sacrifice robustness to achieve computation speed. 
Alternatively, provably safe trajectory planning tends to be computationally intensive and cannot replan trajectories in real time, particularly in environments that are \textit{a priori }unknown. 
We propose FaSTrack, Fast and Safe Tracking, to allow for real-time robust planning of dynamical systems. 
In this framework, real-time computation speed is achieved by allowing any path or trajectory planner to plan using a simplified and efficient \textit{planning model} of the autonomous system.  
The plan is tracked using the autonomous system, represented by a more realistic and higher-dimensional \textit{tracking model}. 
We can precompute the worst-case tracking error due to model-mismatch between the tracking and planning models, as well as due to external disturbances (e.g. wind).  
With this tracking error bound (TEB) we also precompute the corresponding optimal tracking controller used by the autonomous system to stay within the bound during online planning.
The TEB can be either finite time horizon or infinite time horizon depending on the relationship between the tracking and planning models.
In the former case, a time-varying TEB is obtained, and in the latter, a time-invariant TEB is obtained.
Note that since the TEB and optimal tracking controller depend only on the relative state space between the tracking and planning models, the precomputation does not require \textit{a priori} knowledge of the environment.
This framework allows for fast online planning using the planning model, with guaranteed safe real-time tracking of the plan using the TEB and optimal tracking controller.
We demonstrate FaSTrack using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability for the precomputation and three different online trajectory planners with three different tracking-planning model pairs.
