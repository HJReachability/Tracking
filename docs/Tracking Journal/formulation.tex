\section{Problem Formulation}
System dynamics, assumptions on dynamics

Uncertain and certain parts of the dynamics

Goals:
Plan a trajectory to reach goal despite worst-case disturbances

Re-planning must be done in real-time when a new obstacle is found, to account for unknown environments

Tracking must take advantage of realized disturbances (not worst-case)
