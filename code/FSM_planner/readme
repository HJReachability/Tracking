This folder is for the code containing a Hamilton-Jacobi reachability-based planner.
The planner should run close to real time, allowing fast re-planning every time new
information about the environment becomes available. The planner will use the 
fast sweeping method by Osher on a Dubins Car.

The current plan is to implement this planning using parallel computation with BEACLS.
Application: 3-dimensional Dubins car [x,y,theta].
